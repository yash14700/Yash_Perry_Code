Adjacent to the eye this air rises and condenses into huge cumulonimbus clouds that produce heavy rainfall. Near the top of the clouds the relatively dry air having lost much of its moisture begins to flow outward away from the center. This diverging air aloft actually produces a clockwise (anticyclonic in the Northern Hemisphere) flow of air several hundred kilometers from the eye. As this outflow reaches the storm's periphery it begins to sink and warm inducing clear skies. In the vigorous convective clouds of the eyewall the air warms due to the release of large quantities of latent heat. This warming produces slightly higher pressures aloft which initiate downward air motion within the eye. As the air sinks it warms by compression. This process helps to account for the warm air and the absence of thunderstorms in the center of the storm.", "mcq": [], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 27 for Class 191028", "main": "Under what conditions would the moist adiabatic rate of cooling be almost equal to the dry adiabatic rate?", "answer": "When there is an extremely small amount of moisture in the air.", "mcq": [], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 28 for Class 191028", "main": "Why are moist and dry adiabatic rates of cooling different?", "answer": "Dry adiabatic rate is roughly 10 degrees C/km while the moist adiabatic rate is usually slower (around 6 degrees C/km) as condensation in the rising air adds latent heat.", "mcq": [], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 29 for Class 191028", "main": "How does the polar jet stream influence the formation of a mid-latitude cyclone?", "answer": "The polar front jet stream provides areas of divergence aloft.", "mcq": [], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 30 for Class 191028", "main": "Why did you choose to take this course?

A hurricane weakens with height and the area of low pressure at the surface may actually become an area of high pressure above 12 kilometers (40000 feet). Mid-latitude cyclones on the other hand are cold-core lows that usually intensify with increasing height with a cold upper-level low or trough often existing above or to the west of the surface low.
