# Setting up and using code to create google quizzes
## Overview
This program works in 2 parts. 
Part 1 -> Simplify original JSON into a JSON file that could work with Canvas in the future
Part 2 -> Convert the simplified JSON file(s) into a google form
## Using Python file
## Setting up Google Drive to use Quiz Generator
## Using the Google App Script file
## Changes to be worked on
- [ ] Integrate json generator into google app script
- [ ] Figure out how to get google app script to do multiple at once (maybe run in parallel)
- [ ] Talk to 4 help, and get quizes onto canvas -> no need for google app script
