As a parcel of warm humid air rises it cools and condenses into a single. cumulus cloud or a cluster of clouds. As the cloud builds the transformation of water vapor into liquid or solid cloud particles releases large quantities of latent heat a process that keeps the rising air inside the cloud warmer (less dense) than the air surrounding it. The cloud continues to grow in the unstable atmosphere as long as it is constantly fed by rising air from below. In this manner a cumulus cloud may show extensive vertical development and grow into a towering cumulus cloud (cumulus congestus) in just a few minutes. During the cumulus stage there normally is insufficient time for precipitation to form and the updrafts keep water droplets and ice crystals suspended within the cloud. Also there is no lightning or thunder during this stage. As the cloud builds well above the freezing level the cloud particles grow larger and heavier as they collide and join with one another. Eventually the rising air is no longer able to keep them suspended and they begin to fall. While this phenomenon is taking place drier air from around the cloud is being drawn into it in a process called entrainment. The entrainment of drier air causes some of the raindrops to evaporate which chills the air. The air now colder and heavier than the air around it begins to descend as a downdraft . The downdraft may be enhanced as falling precipitation drags some of the air along with it. The appearance of the downdraft marks the beginning of the mature stage. During its mature stage the thunderstorm is most intense. The top of the cloud having reached a stable region of the atmosphere (which may be the stratosphere) begins to take on the familiar anvil shape as upper-level winds spread the cloud's ice crystals horizontally.  Lightning and thunder are also present in the mature stage. After the storm enters the mature stage it begins to dissipate in about 15 to 30 minutes. The dissipating stage occurs when the updrafts weaken as the gust front moves away from the storm and no longer enhances the updrafts. At this stage downdrafts tend to dominate throughout much of the cloud. The reason the storm does not normally last very long is that the downdrafts inside the cloud tend to cut off the storm's fuel supply by destroying the humid updrafts. Deprived of the rich supply of warm humid air cloud droplets no longer form.", "mcq": [], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 4 for Class 191025", "main": "The Ekman Spiral describes:", "answer": "A) the turning of water with depth", "mcq": [{"option": "A) the turning of water with depth", "isAnswer": "true", "order": 1}, {"option": "B) the air flow into a center of low pressure", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 2}, {"option": "C) the circulation of surface water around a gyre", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 3}, {"option": "D) the air flow out of a region of high pressure", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 4}, {"option": "E) the wind-flow pattern in a jet stream", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 5}], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 5 for Class 191025", "main": "The turning of water with depth is known as:", "answer": "B) the Ekman Spiral", "mcq": [{"option": "A) the Hadley Spiral", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 1}, {"option": "B) the Ekman Spiral", "isAnswer": "true", "order": 2}, {"option": "C) a gyre", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 3}, {"option": "D) the Ferrel Spiral", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 4}, {"option": "E) upwelling", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 5}], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 6 for Class 191025", "main": "Just before a storm becomes a fully developed hurricane it is in the ____ stage.

Differences: a hurricane derives its energy from the warm water and the latent heat of condensation whereas the mid-latitude storm derives its energy from horizontal temperature contrasts.

A hurricane weakens with height and the area of low pressure at the surface may actually become an area of high pressure above 12 kilometers (40000 feet). Mid-latitude cyclones on the other hand are cold-core lows that usually intensify with increasing height with a cold upper-level low or trough often existing above or to the west of the surface low. A hurricane usually contains an eye where the air is sinking while mid-latitude cyclones are characterized by centers of rising air.

When winter snows accumulate on the plateau the overlying air grows extremely cold and a shallow dome of high pressure forms near the surface. Along the edge of the plateau the horizontal pressure gradient force is usually strong enough to cause the cold air to flow across the isobars through gaps and saddles in the hills. Along the slopes of the plateau the wind continues downhill as a gentle or moderate cold breeze. If the horizontal pressure gradient increases substantially such as when a storm approaches or if the wind is confined to a narrow canyon or channel the flow of air can increase often destructively as cold air rushes down-slope like water flowing over a waterfall.
